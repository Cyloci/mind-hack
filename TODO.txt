THEME = OUT OF CONTROL

Ideas:
- No control over your character
  - Drunk?
  - Disease?
  - Alien controlling your brain
    - Movement is out of your control, but can use hands?
      - UI: broadcast future movements to player
- Glitches
- Sometimes randomly the the screen goes weird
    or changed color or goes black for a few secs
- random keyboard / mouse inputs
    - UI: make them visible
- random teleportation around level
- Controls change every level
- A control group in study
- Experimenting on people
- Slenderman-esque
  - walk around haunted house, need to collect some items
  - lose control of body Sometimes
  - teleported randomly
  - psychedelic effects/shaders
  - creepy enemy
- Procedural generated levels
-Parkour but you can only use 2 limbs at the time and it switches 
  "randomly" between the other remaining limbs
   -or everytime a beat in the soundtrack plays it switches the limbs aorund
-Story game where you have to catch aliens In a mech, but the mech glitches harder the closer 
they get to the aliens(exploring stroy game)
- you can also go insanely 5Head and use a non-euclidean space
  - since its so confusing its "out of control"

IDEA 1:
3d level
first person perspective
creepy/horror
monsters
  - rabbit = jump higher
  - bat = fly
    - level is dark and have to use echolocation?
  - mouse can crawl throuh small spaces
  - otter = swim in infected water
  - goat can ram stuff with massive 5Head
  - owl can see invisible items with big eyes
  - penguin can be cold spaces
  - take over human at end???
